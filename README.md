# Foundational Project - TechnoGamers University Employee Reimbursement System
## Summary 
This project is about making an employee reimbursement system software that allows you to input expenses for approval throught one application. So basically in this software the employee can request to be reimbursed for a particular amount with some discription, so this would generate a reimbursement ticket. Now the manager of the particular employee must process the ticket and decide if the ticket can be approved or denied. It must also be noted that once one a decision is made by the manager and the ticket is send for processing, no further changes can be made after that point.
